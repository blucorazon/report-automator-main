### High-Level Plan

1. **Setup Google API**: You'll need to set up access to the Google Drive, Docs and Sheets API. This involves creating a project in Google Cloud Platform, enabling the APIs, and obtaining credentials.

2. **Access Google Sheets Data**: Use the Google Sheets API to fetch student data from your spreadsheet. This data will include last names, first names, grades, courses, and course synopses.

3. **Generate Google Docs Reports**: For each student, generate a personalized Google Doc report using the fetched data. These docs will be initially stored in a "To-Do" directory.

4. **Organize Reports by Grade**: Create folders within the "To-Do" directory, each corresponding to a grade. Place the generated reports into their respective grade folders, alphabetized by last name ascending. Che

5. **Marking Reports as Complete**: Implement a mechanism to track which reports are completed. This could be through a naming convention, a status column in your spreadsheet, or moving the Docs to a "Completed" folder.

6. **Automate Transfer to "Completed" Directory**: Once a report is marked as complete, automatically move it to a "Completed" directory, maintaining the grade-based organization.

7. **Integrate with Blackbaud (Bonus)**: Explore Blackbaud's API documentation to see if direct integration is possible for the final data entry step. This will likely involve authentication with Blackbaud, API calls to push data, and error handling.

### Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

1. **Setup Google API**
   - Visit the Google Cloud Platform Console.
   - Create a new project.
   - Enable the Google Drive and Sheets API for your project.
   - Create credentials (OAuth client ID).
   - Download the JSON file containing your credentials.

2. **Access Google Sheets Data**
   - Install the Google client library in Python.
   - Use the credentials file to authorize your application.
   - Fetch the spreadsheet data using the Sheets API.

3. **Generate Google Docs Reports**
   - For each student, create a new Google Doc in the Drive.
   - Populate the Doc with the student's data, formatting it as required.
   - Save the Doc in the "To-Do" directory.

4. **Organize Reports by Grade**
   - Check if a folder for each grade exists in the "To-Do" directory; if not, create it.
   - Move each student's report into the corresponding grade folder.

5. **Marking Reports as Complete**
   - Decide on a method to track completion (e.g., a "Completed" folder, a status column in your spreadsheet).

6. **Automate Transfer to "Completed" Directory**
   - Implement a script that checks for completed reports and moves them to the "Completed" directory.

7. **Integrate with Blackbaud (Bonus)**
   - Review Blackbaud's API documentation for endpoints related to report submission.
   - Implement API calls to submit reports directly to Blackbaud.

### Technologies and Libraries

- **Python**: For scripting and automation.
- **Google Drive API**: To create, organize, and manage Google Docs and folders.
- **Google Sheets API**: To read data from your spreadsheet.
- **Google Docs API**: To generate and edit Docs.
- **Blackbaud API (Optional)**: For direct integration with Blackbaud.

Before diving into the coding aspect, ensure you have Python installed and are comfortable with basic programming concepts in Python. Additionally, familiarize yourself with the APIs mentioned above by reading their documentation and exploring sample code.

This plan lays the foundation for your project. As you progress, you might need to adjust or expand upon it based on your specific requirements and any limitations you encounter.

For a project that interacts with Google APIs like Drive and Docs, especially as your first project, it's a great practice to structure your code in a modular and organized manner. This not only helps in maintaining and understanding the code but also makes it easier to scale and modify in the future. Here's a suggested structure and some best practices:

### Project Structure

1. **Main Script (`main.py`)**: This could be the entry point of your application. It will handle high-level tasks like initializing the application, handling user input, and coordinating the flow between different parts of the application.

2. **Authentication Module (`auth.py`)**: This module will handle the OAuth 2.0 flow, including loading credentials from the JSON file, generating the authorization URL, handling the callback to receive the authorization code, and exchanging it for tokens. It should also handle token storage and refreshing.

3. **Google Drive API Wrapper (`drive_api.py`)**: A wrapper module that encapsulates all interactions with the Google Drive API. This can include functions to create folders, upload files, set file permissions, and any other Drive-related operations your application needs.

4. **Google Docs API Wrapper (`docs_api.py`)**: Similar to the Drive API wrapper, this module would contain functions specific to interacting with Google Docs, such as creating new documents, editing documents, or populating templates with data.

5. **Database Module (`database.py`)**: If you're extracting data from a student database, this module can handle database connections, queries, and data processing. It would fetch the necessary data that you intend to use in your Google Docs.

6. **Utilities (`utils.py`)**: A module for various utility functions that might not fit into the other more focused modules. This could include logging, error handling, and any other cross-cutting concerns.
   - Common Patterns
   - Error Logging
   - Error handling 
   - Data formatting / parsing
   - File formatting
  

7. **Configuration (`config.py`)**: This module can store configuration settings, such as API keys (if needed), database connection settings, and other configurable parameters. Sensitive information should be excluded and managed securely (more on this below).

### Best Practices for Security and Version Control

- **Credential Storage**: The JSON file containing your OAuth 2.0 credentials (often named something like `credentials.json` or `client_secret.json`) should be stored securely and never committed to a public repository. You might:
  - Keep it in a local directory that's referenced in your application but excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.
  - Use environment variables or encrypted secrets management services for sensitive data, especially in production environments.

- **Version Control**: When using version control systems like Git and hosting services like GitHub:
  - Ensure your `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude sensitive files, including your credentials JSON file, any `.env` files, and other sensitive data.
  - Regularly review your commits to ensure no sensitive information is accidentally included.

### Modularization

- **Modular Code**: Breaking your project into modules not only makes the code more manageable but also allows you to reuse code and better isolate functionality. For instance, if you need to change something related to Google Drive operations, you would only need to modify `drive_api.py`.

- **Readability and Maintenance**: Separate modules with clear responsibilities make it easier for you (or others) to read, understand, and maintain the code. This is particularly helpful in debugging and when expanding the project's functionality.

- **Scalability**: As your project grows, a modular structure allows you to add new features more easily. For example, if you decide to interact with another Google API or a different database, you can add new modules without significantly altering the existing codebase.

For your first project, starting with a clear, organized structure and adhering to best practices from the beginning will set a strong foundation, making the development process smoother and more enjoyable.
