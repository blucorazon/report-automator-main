""" TODO:
[ ] Write a preprocessing script for database updates. 
    - We want to be able to update the database ahead of the program
    running. We should be able to add new students into the database, update
    the LS music class enrollments year by year as well as delete (graduate)
    students when they leave DCDS or graduate in 8th grade.
